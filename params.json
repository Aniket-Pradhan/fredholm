{"name":"Fredholm","tagline":"Solves integral equations with singular divergences numerically","body":"### Solving Fredholm equations numerically.\r\n\r\n[Inhomogeneous Fredholm equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredholm_integral_equation) of the first order (inhomogenious) can be written as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHere functions K (called Kernel) and g (inhomogeneous term) are given and f(s) is the function to solve for.\r\n\r\nIn this form, such equation is often encountered in the quantum many-body physics. Depending on the context and details, they are referred to as either integral equations for quantum scattering problem, Dyson's equation or Bethe-Soppiter but have similar underlying feature.\r\n\r\nFor such applications, some common features arise:\r\n\r\n1. The delta function term could be singled out.\r\n\r\n2. If real and complex parts are separated, function diverges under the integral, principal value integral. There are resonances/bound state amplitute contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage.\r\nLet's get down to bussiness, to defeat the Huns! First you need to make sure you have Python 2.7+ with the numpy packages properly installed at your system of choice. To see if that is the case try:\r\n```\r\npython import numpy \r\n```\r\nIf there is no exception, it probably works.\r\n\r\nNow we can download the package:\r\n```\r\ngit checkout\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run tests to see if everything works:\r\n```\r\npython test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis numerical library was developed by [Dima Borzov](http://dimaborzov.com) and used to produce my contributions to the following peer reviewed publications:\r\n\r\n1.
